# InGameEditor.SC2Mod

This is meant to be used as an advanced unit tester, or as a "Trials of the Xel'Naga" sort of game.

Features:

 - Placing units
 - Moving units
 - Editing unit HP / Shields, movement speed, etc. etc.
 - Adding / removing unit weapons (incl. removed / unused weapons)
 - Editing weapon stats such as firing speed / range / splash radius
 - Toggling on / off player upgrades (incl. unused upgrades)
 - Casting spells / using abilities on the map (inlc. removed / ununsed spells)
  
 And much more? 
 
Planned:

 - More features to make this a true unit tester
 - To make it in to some sort of game where players can purchase 'points' to upgrade their units in novel ways (adding weapons or weapon range)
